## Overview
As a PhD student in Dr. Joel Kostkaâ€™s lab, I am interested in how the Deepwater Horizon oil spill affected environmental microorganisms, and the possible mechanisms by which the microbial community aided in removing contaminating oil.

Specifically, I am interested in how indigenous microbial communities initially responded to the oiling event, and how this response evolved overtime. I hope to get at the mechanisms by which the oil was chemically transformed by microbial metabolisms, and what limits or controls these mechanisms.

In order to understand how natural microbes responsed to the oil spill we first need to understand how these systems functioned before the spill. To aid in this, I have been involved in determining the biogeography of microbial populations that have been un-impacted by oil, and using this to predict the microbes that were present before the oil hit. Overall, I hope to aide in developing new approaches to respond to oil spills and increase our predictive capabilities on the effects of oil spills in the environment.

A larger goal of my research is to understand the roles of interactions between microbes in a complex assemblage in responding to a large scale disturbance, like an oil spill. I am interested in why we see multiple, closely related populations, co-existing in an environment and how this diversity is maintained through time. Furthermore I am interested in the genetic mechanisms that exploit (or create) niches, and the role of community interactons on maintaining or defining these niches.
