## Overview
As a PhD student in Dr. Joel Kostkaâ€™s lab, I am interested in how the Deepwater Horizon oil spill affected environmental microorganisms, and the possible mechanisms by which the microbial community aided in removing contaminating oil.

A larger goal of my research is to understand the roles of interactions between microbes in a complex assemblage in responding to a disturbance, like an oil spill. I am interested in why we see multiple, closely related populations, co-existing in an environment and how this diversity is maintained through time. Furthermore I am interested in the genetic mechanisms that exploit (or create) niches, and the role of community interactons on maintaining or defining these niches.
